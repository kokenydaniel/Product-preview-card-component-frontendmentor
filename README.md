## About The Project

This is a small project to practice HTML and CSS. Perfect for anyone who has learned these! The challenge is to build a result summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Built in

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Flex


## What I learned

This is also a smaller project that helped me practice flex setup and responsiveness. I really like doing a lot of these smaller projects because it helps me improve and not forget the basics.

## Acknowledgment

Thanks to everyone who gives feedback on my solution. It definitely helps you find new ways to code and find easier solutions!
